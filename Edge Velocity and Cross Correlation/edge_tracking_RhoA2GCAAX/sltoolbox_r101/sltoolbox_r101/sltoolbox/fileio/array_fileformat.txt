The format of Array file

The first 4 bytes (offset 0 - 3): the tag chars: 'a', 'r', 'r', '\0' (char(0))

The next byte (offset 4) indicates the value type
1:  double
2:  single
3:  logical
4:  char
5:  int8
6:  uint8
7:  int16
8:  uint16
9:  int32
10:  uint32
11:  int64
12:  uint64

The next byte (offset 5) indicates the number of dimensions

The size bytes (from offset 8, 4 * d bytes) use d uint32 numbers to 
characterize the sizes along all dimensions

From offset 8+4*d, is the data region, continuously in column-major order.

The whole file size

8 + 4 * d + bytes/element * element number
