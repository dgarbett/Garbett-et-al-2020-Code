Experiment Description Language Specification
=================================================

Dahua Lin, on Aug 12nd, 2006

1. The language is given in XML file format, with typical file extension as *.edl.xml.

2. In current version, it does not support multi-file project. All experiments should be defined in the same file.

3. The document node
    - Node tag: ExperimentDef
    - Attributes:
        - name: the name describing the experiment set (optional)
        - envconf:  the environment configuration file (a text file with assignment statements) (optional)
        - scriptdir: the directory storing the scripts (optional)
        - reportdir: the directory storing the reports
        - mfiledir:  the directory storing the Matlab M-files (optional)
        - logfile:   the path of log file (optional)
    - Remarks:
        - envconf, scriptdir and mfiledir should be given as path relative to the folder containing the edl file
        - If they are not specified or empty, the corresponding files are considered to be stored in the same folder as well.

4. Experiment Cycle

For each cycle of experiments, they are conducted in several stages:

4.1 Scripting stage: generate the experiment scripts and initial experiment status files.
    The scripting function should be in following form
        S = f(refs, params)
            - refs:     the references as basis of script generation
            - params:   the parameters controlling the generation
                        - should have workdir field
            - S:        the generated property table

4.2 Experiment stage: perform the experiments according to the corresponding script and update the status files.
    The experiment function should be in the following form
        f(params, env, logger)           
            - params:   the experiment parameters extracted from script
            - env:      the environment variables
            - logger:   the logger

4.3 Reporting stage: collect the experiment results and related information and generate reports.
    The report function should be in the following form
        S = f(refs, params, env)
            - refs:     the references as basis of script generation
            - params:   the parameters controlling the generation
            - env:      the environment variables
            - S:        the generated property table

Note that experiments can be conducted selectively and distributively, while scripting and reporting should be conducted in batch.

In addition, the paths passed in these functions are absolute path, for the convenience of the callback. 
However, the callback for scripting or reporting should not rely on the absolute path to generate the contents. 
It is a principle that the contents in the scripts and reports are environment-independent, all environment-dependent factors are passed by env.


4. Elements

4.1. Script: for scripting stage
    - Node tag: Script
    - Attributes:
        name:     the name identifying the script (required)
        func:     the Matlab function to generate script (required)
        path:     the path of the script (optional, default = name.script.xml)
        ctrlpath: the path of the control file (optional, default = scriptpath(no ext).control.xml)
        other attributes are allowed to control the script generation (optional)
    - SubNode: Ref
        - Node tag: Ref
        - Attributes:
            role: the role of the specified reference
            name: the name identifying the script to be referred to
    - SubNode: RefReport
        - Node tag: RefReport
        - Attributes:
            role: the role of the specified reference
            name: the name identifying the report to be referred to     

4.2. Experiment: for experiment stage
    - Node tag: Experiment
        name: the name identifying the experiment (required)
        func: the Matlab function to run each experiment given a specific parameter (required)
        script: the name identifying the script (optional, by default it is the same as the experiment name)

4.3. Report: for reporting stage
    - Node tag: Report
    - Attributes:
        name: the name identifying the report (required)
        func: the Matlab function to generate report (required)
        path: the path of the report (optional, default = name.report.xml)
        other attributes are allowed to control the report generation (optional)
    - SubNode: Ref
        - Node tag: Ref
        - Attributes:
            role: the role of the specified reference
            name: the name identifying the script to be referred to
    - SubNode: RefReport
        - Node tag: RefReport
        - Attributes:
            role: the role of the specified reference
            name: the name identifying the report to be referred to    

4.4 Var: for variable definition
    - The EDL allows definition of variables, which can be used in attribute specification 
    - The use of variable is as "$<var name>".
    - You can not use variable value to specify the name of another element.

4.5 Group: for grouping experiments
    - Groups give a way for work diretory embedding and parameter inheritance
    - The parameters defined in group attributes will be feed to script generation
    - If the script nodes revise the attributes specified in their outer group, the subnodes take priority.
