The specification of the class representing a dataset from DSDML
(DSDML = DataSet Description Markup Language)

The structed is tagged as an object of class 'dataset'.

The struct contains following fields

The header fields
- version:      the version of the DSDML Language 
                a char string in the form 'major version.minor version'
- name:         the name of the data set, a char string
- unittype:     the string telling unit type: 'Sample' or 'SampleGroup'
- format:       the format of the data, a char string
- author:       the char string giving the author list
- description:  the char string describing the data set.
- attribs:      the other attributes of the data set 
                these fields will exist only when the XML element
                contains the attributes

The data fields
- units:        the struct array of all units (samples or samplegroups)

The sample struct contains the following fields
- class_id:     the id identifying which class it belongs to
- filename:     the (main) filename of the sample
- attribs

The sample group struct contains the following fields
- class_id:     the id identifying which class it belongs to 
- samples:      the struct array of the group of samples
- attribs

The properties for dataset
All fields can be got/set as properties, including:
    - version
    - name
    - unittype
    - format
    - author
    - description
    - attribs
In addition, the other attributes can be directly got/set by their names.
Furthermore, we can retrieve(get) following derived properties:
- numsamples:   the total number of samples
- numgroups:    the total number of groups
- numunits:     the total number of units
- samples:      the struct array of all sample structs
- groups:       the struct array of all sample groups
- class_ids:    the integer array of all class ids of samples
- filenames:    the string array of all filenames
- nums:         the numbers of samples for each class_id
                (precondition: the samples of the same class are arranged together)
- numspergrp:   the numbers of samples per groups 
- grpnums:      the numbers of groups per class
- grpclass_ids: the integer array of all sample groups
(All these properties are given in form of column array)
