1. Representation of General Graph

In sltoolbox, there are multiple ways to represent a graph.

1.1 Edge set representation

The graph is given as a node set and an edge set. In matlab, it is given 
by a struct with two fields: n and edges. Here n is the number of nodes, 
then the set of nodes are denoted by 1, 2, ..., n. edges is an nedges x 2
matrix, with each row being [i1, i2] denoting the edge from i1 to i2.
For valued graph, the edges can be an nedges x 3 matrix, with each
row being [i1, i2, v]. 

1.2 Adjacent list representation

The graph is given by the set of neighborhood of all nodes. In matlab,
it is given as a struct of two fields: n and targets. Here, n is the number
of nodes, while target is a length-n cell array. The i-th cell can be in 
either of the two forms:
nt_i x 1 column vector: indicating the targets of the i-th vertex
nt_i x 2 matrix: indicating the targets of the i-th vertex and the 
                 corresponding edge value.

1.3 Adjacency matrix

An n x n matrix A: That A(i, j) > 0 implies that there exists an edge
from node i to node j. A can be either a full matrix or a sparse matrix.
The values of A can be numeric or logical. 


2. Representation of bigraph

A bipartite graph, also called bigraph, is a graph with two disjoint sets
of nodes, say A and B. Every edge in a bigraph has one end in A and the 
other end in B. In statistical learning, a special type of bigraph worth
special attention, which we call unidirectional bigraph. In such type of
graph, all edges are from some node in A to a node in B. Here, we call 
A the source node set, and B the target node set. Though undirectional
bigraph is a graph, however, it is typically more effective to use a 
special representation for it. In set theory, it can be characterized by
{A, B, E}, A is the source node set, B is the target node set, and E
is the edge set. 

In sltoolbox, we have three forms to represent a bigraph

2.1 Edge set representation

It is given by a struct with three fields: n, nt, and edges. Here n is
the number of source nodes, nt is the number of target nodes, and edges
can have two forms. The first form is a nedges x 2 matrix, with each row
being [i, j], denoting the edge from the i-th node in A to the j-th node
in B. The second form is a nedges x 3 matrix, with each row being
[i, j, v], where v is the value associated with the edge from the i-th 
source node to the j-th target node.

2.2 Adjacency list representation

It is given by a struct with three fields: n, nt, and targets. Here n is the
number of source nodes, nt is the number of target nodes, and targets is a
cell array of length n, with the i-th cell containing an nt_i x 1 column 
vector of the indices of the targets from i-th source or an nt_i x 2 matrix 
of both the indices and the corresponding values. 

2.3 Adjacency matrix representation

It is given by an n x nt matrix. The entry in the i-th row and j-th column
represents the existence or value of the edge from the i-th source and
the j-th target. The matrix can be logical or numeric. 

3. About Neighborhood Graph

You can use a graph or bigraph to represent neighborhood relation. Suppose
in a neighborhood system, representing the neighbors of n samples, where
the neighbors are from a set of n0 samples. Then it is a graph of n0 source
nodes and n target nodes. The non-zero from the i-th source node to the
j-th target node means that the i-th sample in the referenced set is a 
neighbor of the j-th sample in the target set (i-th source contributes to
the construction of j-th target, for a valued graph, the value in 
corresponding position represents the weight of contribution).
