function vfb = slvecfilters(fb)
%SLVECFILTERS Vectorizes the filter band
%
% $ Syntax $
%   - vfb = slvecfilters(fb)
%
% $ Arguments $
%   - fb:       The filter band
%   - vfb:      The vectorized filter band
%   
% $ Description $
%   - vfb = slvecfilters(fb) vectorizes the filter band. A set of filter
%     band is an array of size (ph x pw x ...). In its vectorized form,
%     each filter is vectorized as a row vector. Then for a set of 
%     filter band with same size, vfb is a matrix of size k x d, here 
%     d = ph x pw, while k is the number of filters.
