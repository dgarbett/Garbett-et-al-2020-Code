In sltoolbox, a Gaussian distribution model is represented by a struct.
Depending on different configurations, the struct contains different
fields.

For all types of Gaussian models, the following fields must exist:
    - dim:      the dimension of sample space (d)
    - nmodels:  the number of models (k)
    - means:    the array of all mean values (d x k)

In addition, they will have a field named either 'vars' or 'covs', based on
different settings of the variances(covariance).

They have six different forms:
For each form, we use the notation [<variance form>|<whether is shared>] 
to represent its key properties in variance.

1. Gaussian model(s) with a variance shared by all components and all models 
   ['univar'|true]
    - vars:     the variance value (1 x 1)

2. Gaussian model(s) with each model has a variance value ['univar'|false]
    - vars:     the array of all variance values (1 x k)

3. Gaussian model(s) with component-wise variances (diagonal covariance matrix) 
   shared by all models. ['diagvar'|true]
    - vars:     the array of the variance values of components (d x 1)

4. Gaussian model(s) with component-wise variances (diagonal covariance matrix)
   shared by all models. ['diagvar'|false]
    - vars:     the array of the variance values of components (d x k)

5. Gaussian model(s) with full covariance matrix shared by all models
   ['covar'|true]
    - covs:     the covariance matrix (d x d)

6. Gaussian model(s) with each model having its own covariance matrix
   ['covar'|false]
    - covs:     the array of covariance matrices (d x d x k)

For the models that would be used to evaluate Malalanobis distance or pdf,
the following fields are required
    - invvars (corresponding to 1-4) or invcovs(corresponding to 5-6)

For Gaussian Mixtured Model (GMM), it will have the following field:
    - mixweights: a k x 1 vector giving the weight of each constituent model


We offer following m-functions to do computations based on Gaussian models

- slgausstype:      to check the validity of structure and judge the type of the Gaussian model
- slgausscomb:      to combine multiple Gaussian models to form a single struct
- slgaussrnd:       to generate random samples from Gaussian model(s)
- slgaussest:       to estimate the parameters of Gaussian model(s) from vector samples
- slgausspdf:       to evaluate the probability density function (pdf) on samples
- slgmm:            to learn Gaussian Mixture model (GMM) based slfmm
